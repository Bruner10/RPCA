Robust Principal Component Analysis and Its Application to Digital Imagery

This is my final project for my Numerical Linear Algebra class at the University of Central Oklahoma. 
The code is written in Octave, but should only need minor updates to be ran in Matlab.

See the FinalPaper.docx to read the full paper.

For all code used see the Code folder

For the before and after images of Example 1 and 2 (Block and Noise Corruption) go to the Buddy Images folder

For the Original, Low Rank, and Sparse GIFs for Example 3 (Motion Capture) go to the GIF folder.

The SurveillanceGIF, LowRank_Frames, and Sparse_Frames folders have the individual frames for the GIFS in the GIF folder
